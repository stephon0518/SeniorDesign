## Project Description
CityScope is a web application that recommends places to visit in Cincinnati based on what youâ€™re looking for. So, restaurants, museums, parks, libraries, coffee shops, etc. Let's say you're looking for coffee shops in Cincinnati. Enter that into the search box and a list of coffee shops will be displayed. The user will then be able to sort the list of recommended coffee shops by rating, price or number of reviews.
